# Rapid GraphQL
Rapid GraphQL is a Java framework for rapid development of graphql service in the so called code-first approach.
In this approach GraphQL schema is derived automatically from the code. 

Most other Java frameworks choose schema-first approach in which first schema is designed first and then code should be written to match the schema.
Schema-first approach, although being more declarative, complicates development by requiring constant synchronization between the schema and code.
Code generation is used by some frameworks to simplify this synchronization, but it introduces other issues.
